Oh hey! I’m [Paul Armstrong](https://paularmstrong.dev/about) and this is my website. Trying to figure out how this all works? Well here’s the high level:

- Built on [Astro](https://astro.build)
- Super minimal amount of Solid-js for dark/light/auto theme switching
- Markdown and MDX for content
- Github actions for lint, formatting, and type checks
- Netlify for deploying

## Good stuff to know

## PR Etiquette

### I found a typo or grammatical error, should I open a PR?

Yes! Absolutely!. We all make mistakes – especially me. Your help is greatly appreciated.

### I think you’re wrong, should I open a PR?

Probably not. It’s great that you disagree, but I probably don’t have the time to argue.
