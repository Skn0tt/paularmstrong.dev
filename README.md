# PaulArmstrong.dev

Oh hey! I’m [Paul Armstrong](https://paularmstrong.dev/about) and this is my website. Trying to figure out how this all works? Well here’s the high level:

- Built on [Astro](https://astro.build)
- Super minimal amount of Solid-js for dark/light/auto theme switching
- Markdown and MDX for content
- Github actions for lint, formatting, and type checks
- Github actions for deploying – to Github pages

## Good stuff to know

| Command                         | What                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `yarn start` (alias `yarn dev`) | Run the dev server                |
| `yarn build`                    | Build for production deploy       |
| `yarn preview`                  | Preview the production built site |
| `yarn format`                   | Format code                       |
| `yarn lint`                     | Lint code                         |
| `yarn tsc`                      | Type check                        |

## PR Etiquette

### I found a typo or grammatical error, should I open a PR?

Yes! Absolutely!. We all make mistakes – especially me. Your help is greatly appreciated.

### I think you’re wrong, should I open a PR?

Probably not. It’s great that you disagree, but I probably don’t have the time to argue.
