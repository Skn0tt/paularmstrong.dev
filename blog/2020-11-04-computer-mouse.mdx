I absolutely love the multi-touch surface of the Apple Magic Mouse 2. It's easy, it's intuitive, and it's _natural_. Unfortunately, the mouse is wildly non-ergonomic. Almost just as importantly, the battery seems to die, without fail, an hour into my work-day. In order to get any work done, I need a _backup_ $79 Apple Magic Mouse 2.

In fits of rage, every couple of weeks when the battery died, I would try to live with just using the keyboard. Unfortunately, too many websites that I need to use daily are completely inaccessible. Tabbing around the page just doesn't work.

So I needed a better solution. Sadly, though, no one else seems to make a reputable multi-touch surface mouse that doesn't have a proprietary port on its under-side that renders it useless while charging.

I finally convinced myself to _just try_ something different. Being the recipient of a gift card, it was easier to convince myself that it was like someone had just given me a mouse as the gift instead. So I dove in and bought one of the highest-rated, the _Logitech MX Master 3_.

        Notice the way my hand naturally lays when I set it on the Apple mouse. There's a lot of dead space between my
        hand and the device. But more importantly, the shape of my hand looks like it would fit perfectly on top of the
        Logitech mouse.

        The contours of the Logitech MX Master 3 are exactly that of how I naturally set my hand down on the mouse.

And most importantly, the Logitech MX Master 3 boasts up to 70 days of battery life on a full charge, with providing up to 3 hours of life by charging for just 1-minute! And, most importantly, the USB-C port is on the front of the device and can be plugged in _and_ used at the same time. It's ridiculous to me that something so normal to need is completely ignored by Apple.

### Logitech MX Master 3

## Verdict

It hasn't been long since I started using this Logitech mouse, but so far I'm inclined to say that it will be a headache-saver for me. Would I buy it over the Apple mouse again? Yes.

Especially because I can now pair a single mouse with multiple computers. This is a huge win for me, because I switch between my work and personal computers all the time. I no longer have the need to have multiple mice with labels written in sharpie on the bottom so I know which is which.
