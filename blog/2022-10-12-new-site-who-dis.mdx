I needed an escape while stressing about my (previously) upcoming wedding. Having some personal annoyances with how difficult it would be to personalize <a href="https://docusaurus.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Docusaurus</a>, I sat down and hacked at <a href="https://astro.build" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Astro</a> for a day and a half. I came up with a fully working static website & blog in no time.

## Requirements

I had just a few requirements for my site:

- The ability to write pages and blog posts with Markdown and MDX.
  - I originally used Docusaurus because I wanted to force myself to spend more time _writing_ than tinkering with the page. This worked, to a point, and I’d like to keep it easy to focus on writing.
- The site should be served as statically built HTML pages.
  - There really should be no need for a big backend CMS. Just write pages and push to a source control origin.
- The layout should be fully customizable.
  - This is the kicker that is moving me away from Docusaurus. While much of the framework’s built-in components can be _swizzled_ and replaced with custom versions, much of it still cannot, and I do not feel like I have the knowledge depth to contribute.

## Options

I set out looking at options:

- **Docusaurus** I absolutely love Docusaurus. I will continue to use it for documentation sites as the first tool I reach for. But for my personal site, it just wasn’t cutting it.
- **Next.js** People seem to love this. I’m still not fully convinced that the weight of the development environment and the prescriptive way of building things is best for me. I _have_ been forcing myself to use it for a couple things, but it just isn’t clicking as _the killer_ framework to me.
- **Gatsby** No. Just no. Every time I see a Gatsby site, it pulls down at least 10MB of JavaScript. Honestly, I haven’t actually tried Gatsby in a number of years, but last I did, I was turned off by the ergonomics of it. I have no idea if the anecdote about JS size is real or just a red herring.
- **Eleventy** Looks great, haven’t tried it. (aside: The amount of effort the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eleventy documentation</a> spends trying to convince me to use it makes me extra skeptical)
- **Astro** I’ve heard a lot of rave reviews. So I started with this one, just thought I was diving in.

## Accidentally choosing Astro

I started just toying with Astro for building my site, and before I knew it, within just a few hours, I was mostly done building the basic framework with something that was pleasing enough to look at and work with.

Sitting back for a minute on it, I decided to just run with it. So far, it has been a pleasure to work with and has actually inspired me to really get some content written. Let’s hope it continues.
