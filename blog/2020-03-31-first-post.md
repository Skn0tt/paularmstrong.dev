It's about that time again. I'm actually creating a personal site after deleting the one I had from about 2004 through 2015. I got tired of maintaining the framework that I kept building my site in. It became more of a chore maintaining the code than adding fresh content. So here we are. New site! Who dis?

This time around, I've chosen a framework that I hope will allow me to focus on the contents of the site, rather than how the site is built and maintained. I've really enjoyed using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io) for building documentation on various projectsâ€”and since it has a built-in ability to write a blog by adding Markdown files, I figured that I'll give it a shot.

No promises on regular updates, but I'm going to do my best.
