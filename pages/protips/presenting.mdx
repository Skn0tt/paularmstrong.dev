## General

### Disable notifications

Turn off your system & push notifications! On Mac OS X, it's as easy as <kbd aria-label="hold option">‚å•</kbd>+<kbd aria-label="click left mouse button">click</kbd> on the notification icon in the top right of the menubar. This will disable all notifications from displaying until you re-enable them using the same action.

### Clean the Desktop

Short of deleting all of those files that you're hoarding, you can add a couple quick terminal shortcuts to hide and show all of the items on your desktop.

```bash title="Add to your ~/.zshrc"
function hide-desktop() {
  defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false
  killall Finderremark
}

function show-desktop() {
  defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true
  killall Finder
}
```

Then, any time that you are about to start presenting, type `hide-desktop` into your terminal.

### Close browser tabs

Or just open a new window and minimize your current window. It's fine if you're a tab-hoarder and don't want to close any, but they're really distracting to anyone else looking at your screen.

I even go one step further and create a separate Chrome profile just for presenting and screen-sharing. I keep no bookmarks and delete history frequently. This keeps my setup fresh, clean, and without any potential distractions.

Also recommended, some blanked out start page. I use [Minim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minim-new-tab-for-minimal/kpblgdhkligkbbnbpkigppblggflihgn) as my start tab.

## Code samples

### Carbon

Paste code samples and export syntax-highlighted code on [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh). Perfect for emails and presentations when you want to share some code, but make it look pretty.

### Terminalizer

Don't chance the inevitable with a broken live demo in your commandline! Want to share your terminal input & output, but feel like the static image isn't very good? Use [Terminalizer](https://terminalizer.com) to record and generate animated gifs or videos.

#### Install

Terminalizer is a commandline application written in Node.js that you need to install.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g terminalizer
```

```bash title="Generating GIFs"
# start recording
terminalizer record demo
# proceed to do whatever you want recorded
# ^D (CTRL-D) when done

# Render a GIF
terminalizer render demo
```

A quick sample that I recorded while working on this content:
