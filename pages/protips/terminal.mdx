## ZSH navigation

### `CDPATH`

I often find myself wanting to drop into a specific directory somewhere else in my system than my current path. Instead of always needing to run `cd ~/development/foo/bar/baz`, we can shorten that up by using `auto_cd` in ZSH (`CDPATH` in Bash).

```shell title="~/.zshrc"
setopt auto_cd
cdpath=($HOME/development)
```

Once I've set this in my `~/.zshrc` and reloaded the configuration, I can run `cd foo/bar/baz` and it'll get me to the same spot that I tried previously.

Or, you can take this one step further and add `autopushd`

```shell title="~/.zshrc"
setopt auto_cd
cdpath=($HOME/development)
```

Now, you can automatically jump to directories without typing `cd`:

```shell
$ pwd
/home
$ foo/bar/baz
$ pwd
~/development/foo/bar/baz
```

### No more `cd ../../..`

I'm super lazy and repeatedly going back up a number of directories is annoying to type out, so I have this ridiculous set of aliases:

```shell title="~/.zshrc"
alias ..="cd .."
alias ...="cd ../.."
alias ....="cd ../../.."
alias .....="cd ../../../.."
alias ......="cd ../../../../.."
alias .......="cd ../../../../../.."
alias ........="cd ../../../../../../.."
alias .........="cd ../../../../../../../.."
alias ..........="cd ../../../../../../../../.."
alias ...........="cd ../../../../../../../../../.."
alias ............="cd ../../../../../../../../../../.."
alias .............="cd ../../../../../../../../../../../.."
```

## ZSH auto-suggestions

If you're using zsh and you don't have it, you need [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).

![demo of zsh-autosuggestions](/img/zsh-autosuggestions.gif)

Just start typing and it will suggest commands from your history without you needing to type <kbd aria-label="hold control">⌃</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>. Hit your <kbd aria-label="right arrow">→</kbd> key to accept the suggestion, then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run.
