## ZSH Navigation

I often find myself wanting to drop into a specific directory somewhere else in my system than my current path. Instead of always needing to run `cd ~/development/foo/bar/baz`, we can shorten that up by using `auto_cd` in ZSH (`CDPATH` in Bash).

```bash title="~/.zshrc"
setopt auto_cd
cdpath=($HOME/development)
```

Once I've set this in my `~/.zshrc` and reloaded the configuration, I can run `cd foo/bar/baz` and it'll get me to the same spot that I tried previously.

Or, you can take this one step further and add `autopushd`

```bash title="~/.zshrc"
setopt auto_cd
cdpath=($HOME/development)
```

Now, you can automatically jump to directories without typing `cd`:

```bash
$ pwd
/home
$ foo/bar/baz
$ pwd
~/development/foo/bar/baz
```
